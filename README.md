# Call-Center-Data-Analysis

In this project we use a dataset from ‘Real World Fake Data’, Import it to MySQL Workbench, clean it and then analyse it. At last, used Tableau to visualize the data.

I worked with a dataset from the Real World Fake Data. You can download it from the link below -

They offer a fantastic array of datasets across various domains, so you're bound to find one that piques your interest. In my case, I've selected the 'call centre' dataset, which boasts over 32,900 records detailing calls to various call centres. This dataset encompasses call IDs, call durations in minutes, caller names, satisfaction scores, and a host of other attributes that we'll explore as we progress.

With our dataset in hand, the next step is to import it into MySQL Workbench.

I have shared all the steps I have done in MySQL Workbench.

Lastly, I have also made a dashboard using Tableau. You can have a look-
